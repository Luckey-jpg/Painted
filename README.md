PAINTED CRUMB CO.

This is a website I made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
This is a Site for a small start up Business called "Painted Crumb Co." 
It works on Both PC and Mobile. 
With a Menu I added for the mobile to make the user experience very easy.

The Contact form uses a Google API. 
When your information has been added and you click "Submit" It will send it to a google Sheet. 

This Can be seen at the end of the JS File ("script.js") 

The Code For Google API I used is thanks to this GitHub Repository:
https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets

This where I got the code for the Google API. 

Comments: 
I added Comments In The HTML and CSS because there is quite a lot of code.
It really helps me code since I know where everything starts and ends, Making it a lot easier to change and adjust things.


HTML: 
The HTML for this site is very basic.
Just includes some sections, a form and textarea.
Used Icons on the Site form : Font Awesome 
With this I was able to all the Icons on the site including the menu that you will on mobile devices. 
Along with a "X" to exit out of the menu on mobile.



CSS: 
Used very Basic CSS with this, the Comments will help navigate through the code for later adjustments. 
At the end of the of CSS file is the CSS for the mobile Responsive.


JavaScript: 
The JavaScript is also very basic stuff.
All The JavaScript for this site is to make the Mneu on mobile function and for the Contact Form to function.
